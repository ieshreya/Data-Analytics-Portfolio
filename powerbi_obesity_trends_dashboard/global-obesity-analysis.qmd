# Introduction

Obesity is a major global public health concern associated with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and reduced quality of life. It poses significant challenges for governments, healthcare systems, and communities worldwide.

This project analyzes **global obesity trends** from 2011 to 2023, along with physical activity and nutritional patterns, to draw insights for targeted public health interventions.

**KPI Metrics:** Obesity Rate vs. Physical Inactivity Rate (2011–2023).

### Chart 7: High-Risk Population Matrix  
**Objective:** Pinpoint populations with highest combined risk (obesity + inactivity + poor diet).  
**KPI Metrics:** Obesity Rate, Physical Inactivity Rate, and Insufficient Fruit Consumption Rate by Demographics and Location.

### Chart 8: Activity and Diet Correlation Bubble Chart  
**Objective:** Examine relationships among activity, diet, and obesity metrics.  
**KPI Metrics:** Physical Inactivity Rate, Insufficient Fruit Consumption Rate, and Obesity Rate with slicers for Year and Demographics.


# DAX Measures

Below are the DAX measures I used for calculating KPIs in the Power BI dashboard.



### YoY Change
Calculates the year-over-year change in average prevalence rate for the selected year.

```DAX
YoY_Change = 
VAR CurrentYear = SELECTEDVALUE(obesity_data[Year])
VAR HasOneYear = HASONEVALUE(obesity_data[Year])

VAR CurrentValue = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]), 
    obesity_data[Year] = CurrentYear
)

VAR PrevValue = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]),
    obesity_data[Year] = CurrentYear - 1
)

VAR Change = DIVIDE(CurrentValue - PrevValue, PrevValue)

RETURN 
IF(
    NOT HasOneYear,
    "-",
    IF(CurrentYear = 2011, 0, Change)
)
```


### InactivityRate

Computes the proportion of adults reporting no leisure-time physical activity.

```DAX
InactivityRate = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]) / 100,
    obesity_data[Category] = "Physical Inactivity"
)
```
### MaxObesity

Returns the obesity rate for the most recent year in the dataset.

```DAX
MaxObesity = 
IF(
    MAX(obesity_data[Year]) = CALCULATE(MAX(obesity_data[Year]), ALL(obesity_data)),
    [ObesityRate],
    BLANK()
)
```

### NationalObesityRate

Calculates the national-level obesity rate (category “Overweight”) across all regions.
```DAX
NationalObesityRate = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]),
    obesity_data[Category] = "Overweight",
    ALL(obesity_data[Region])
)
```
### NutritionRate

Calculates the average prevalence of healthy dietary behavior (fruit and vegetable consumption).
```DAX
NutritionRate = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]) / 100,
    FILTER(
        obesity_data, 
        obesity_data[Category] = "Nutrition - Fruit" ||
        obesity_data[Category] = "Nutrition - Vegetable"
    )
)
```
### ObesityRate

Determines the overall obesity prevalence rate (category “Overweight”).

```DAX
ObesityRate = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]) / 100,
    obesity_data[Category] = "Overweight"
)
```
### AllRegion

Calculates the average prevalence rate across all regions for comparison.
```DAX
AllRegion = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(obesity_data[Data_Value]),
    ALL(obesity_data[Region])
)
```


## Conclusion

- From 2011 to 2023, global obesity rates have kept going up, even though people are more aware of health and nutrition.

- The dashboard shows that women and college graduates tend to have higher obesity rates, which could be linked to lifestyle or work habits.

- Lack of activity and poor eating habits are clearly tied to obesity across all groups, and some ethnic groups, especially non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations, face higher combined risks.

- A few regions have improved in activity levels, but overall, global efforts have not been enough to slow down obesity growth.



## Recommendations
1. Focus more programs on groups and areas where obesity and inactivity are highest.
2. Combine exercise and healthy eating campaigns instead of treating them separately.
3. Use real behavior data to make lifestyle tips more personal and practical.
4. Keep tracking the numbers every year to see what’s working and fix what’s not.
5. Bring more health education into schools and offices in a simple, consistent way.
6. Get healthcare, food, and education sectors to work together on long-term solutions.
