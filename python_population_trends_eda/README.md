# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python: Global Population Trends

- **Objective**: To investigate population trends from year 1950-2021, find out any growth patterns, and validate our findings using statistical methods.
- **Data Source**: [Population Growth: Published online at OurWorldinData.org](https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth)


In this analysis, we will explore global population trends over time and demographic data across different age groups. Using Python, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, compare pre- and post-2000 population distributions, and perform statistical tests to validate insights.
